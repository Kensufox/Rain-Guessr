need a map to point the answer (can make different type of map: game like, full 2D) (will probably use Isaac map)
have something that calcul points gain from answer (base on: correct region, correct room, distance, time take)
have a picture bank of player in random place (a lot for it to not repeat) (probably not)
a program that play the game (select a position, set a timer, and other parameter essential to a good game)
have a menu to play the game and acces other menu:
-setting : can change language, and other things (no idea for the moment)
-account : register or login to your account to register your score
-play    : you can choose a game mode and diffulculty and play de game
-credit  : credit for all the dev and all the asser/code use

game mode:
-classique : just like geo guesser (similar to Isaac project)

that all my idea for now, I think it's already a lot of thing to make, 
I will try my best to make all of this work.


(I hope I can finish this project, I love Rain World, and I want to make something that other fan can enjoy
playing. It's also an opportunity for me to exerce programming in multiple way)
